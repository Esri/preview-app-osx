# app-framework-demo-osx

This is a demo that shows how to use the EAF (Esri Application Framework). The EAF is a sample framework that contains course grained view controllers written on top of the Esri ArcGIS Runtime SDK for OS X.

This is the demo app that was shown in the ArcGIS Runtime for OS X session at the 2013 Esri Developer Summit.

To use the EAF you must installed the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for OS X 10.2 Beta](http://developers.arcgis.com/en/os-x/)

Another example of using the EAF is the [ArcGIS Runtime Preview application](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=db0e7ce0bd5143faaff25e8588848d3d). You can download source for that application [here](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=038213d942cc4db49b1c5bc716377721)
